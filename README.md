# Sample-NeuralNetwork-Workbook

Combines different work pages  with different tasks. Most parts was done with help [This Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrBzGHKmGDcwLFnQGHJ3XYg), Thanks Author for the Great Resource!

#### ColorMovingEvolution
(c) Well the environment spits out a state, the agent transforms that state using a differentiable function (typically a neural network) into a probability distribution over actions. It samples an action using that distribution, and executes it in the environment, which in turn spits out a new state and reward."


#### FlowerPetalsNeuron
(c) Solving the flower problem. Our farmer wants to predict a flowers type, only knowing the width and length of its petal. We want to predict that last flowers color, and also end up with a neural network that can classify future flowers!


#### CharMatchingEvolution
Based on source about [Machine Larning on JS](https://www.burakkanber.com/blog/machine-learning-genetic-algorithms-part-1-javascript/). And, what is important, projects don't represent Machine Larning, but simple example of generation and mutation flow.
